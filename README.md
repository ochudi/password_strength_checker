# Password Strength Checker
This project lets you check whether your password is strong enough.

## Description
It does this by checking the number of letters, numbers, special characters, and whitespace characters within a given password and generating a score based on these results. I used the string and getpass modules from the Python standard library.

## Run Program
```bash
python3 main.py
```
